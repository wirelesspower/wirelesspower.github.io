# Wireless Power Transfer

- Can be divided in to two broad categories
- Radiative transmission through far-field principles
 - Examples include power transfer through radio-frequency, microwave, optical and ultrasonic technologies
 - At an experimental stage of development
 - Start-up companies such as ubeam, energous, WI-Charge, etc. are working in this space
 - AirFuel Alliance is developing standards
- Non-radiative transmission through near-field principles
 - Inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) technologies are utilised
 - IPT is the most mature technology as it has been used in industrial applications since 90s
 - A number of companies such a Daifuku, Conductix Wampfler, Apple, WitriCity, Bombardier, Wave IPT etc. are working in this space
 - WPC, SAE, etc. standards are been developed

---

# IPT Applications

- Factory automation and materials handling
 - Includes hoists, AGVs and and clean room systems  
- Consumer electronics and appliances
 - Charging phones, laptops, etc. as well as powering appliances 
- Transportation electrification 
 - Charging stationary and in-motion electric vehicles, charging electric ferries, etc.
- Biomedical
 - Charging and powering medical devices as well as implants
- Lighting and industrial applications  
 - Provides wireless power and communication to applications such as tunnel lighting, minning, industrial machinery, robots, etc.

# Components of an IPT System


.center[<img src="img/fund/IPTConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- Primary consists of a DC-AC switched-mode converter, a compensation network and a transmitter coil(s) 
 - A lumped transmitter coil is often referred to as a primary pad/coil/coupler 
 - An elongated coil is often called a primary track
 - Can be directly fed by a DC source or through a grid-connected AC-DC converter
- Secondary/pick-up consists of a reciever coil(s), a compensation network and an AC-DC converter
 - The reciever coil is is often referred to as a secondary/pick-up pad/coil/coupler
- Primary and pick-up coils are magnetically coupled but the coupling coefficient is less than 40%
- The compensation networks help improve efficiency by minimizing the VA requirements of converters

---

# Current Status

- Uni or bi-directional power flow
 - Primary may use a full-bridge, half-bridge, push-pull, multi-level or matrix based converter topology
 - Pick-up may use a boost, buck, full- or half-bridge and push-pull topology
 - Control techniques that facilitate ZVS/ZCS over a wide range of conditions
 - Compensation for both sides is provided through series, parallel or a combination of series-parallel tuned networks
- Power ratings up to tens of kWs
 - Magnetic designs include circular coil, solenoidal coil, polarised coil, multi coil structures as well as track based systems 
 - Ferrites and/or reflections coils often used to shape the magnetic fields generated
 - Transmission range of over 400 mm with over Â± 200 mm XY tolerance
 - Efficiency typically over 85% but can be as high as 97%
 - Operating frequency typically range from tens of kHz to tens of MHz

# Modelling the Primary and Pick-up Coils

.center[<img src="img/fund/IPTConcSys.png" height="170px">]

- The behaviour of the coils can be modelled using a T equivelent transformer model
 - `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils
 - `\(\phi_{m}\)` represents flux linkage while `\(\phi_{lk_p}\)` and `\(\phi_{lk_s}\)` represent leakage flux
 - The coupling coefficient, k, between the coils is less than 0.4 in a typical IPT system
- The mutual inductance, M, between the two coils is given by
\\[M = k\sqrt{L\_{pt}L\_{st}}\\]

# Power Transfer Efficiency and Coil Q

.left-column[
- Boost inductors integrated in to the DD pad
- Designed to comply with WPT2/Z2 specifications
- Controlled both the GA and VA to maintain a nearly constant efficiency under all operating conditions

# Hybrid Compensation Topologies

.left-column[
- Complementary compensation networks employed to improve misalignment tolerance 
- Require less or no control 
- Nearly constant power transfer across the entire operating region
- Minimize increase in VA due to detuning caused by changes in coupler inductanes  
- For example the power throughput of a parallel hybrid system can be given by

\\[P\_{out} = \{8V\_{in}V\_{out}\over\pi^2} \left(\frac{1}{\omega\_TM\_s} + \frac{M\_p}{\omega\_TL\_{pi}L\_{si}}\right)\\]

# Low Cost IPT Systems

.left-column[
- For example push-pull converters employed in both VA and GA 
 - DC indcutor(s) and current splitting transformer can be integrted in with the D coupler
 - Generates a higher voltage to drive the couplers   
 - Relative phase between converters controls the power flow
 - Switches maintain ZVS across the entire operating region
