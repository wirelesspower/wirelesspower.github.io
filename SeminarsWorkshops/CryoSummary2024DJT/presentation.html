# GaN HEMTs - R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> at 77K

- The performance of GaN HEMTs in cryogenic temperatures depends on the gate technology
 - Devices with ohmic p-GaN gates do not perform well 
 - The series Si-FET in a cascode limits improvement in R<sub>DS(ON)</sub>

- The threshold voltage of devices with Schottky p-GaN gates reduces with temperature
 - In contrast the threshold voltage of cascodes and devices with ohmic p-GaN devices increases with reducing temperature

# Si Switches - R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> at 77K

- The R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> of Si MOSFETs improve until about 120K 
- The R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> of Si-Superjunction MOSFETs decrease until about 120K but starts to increase quite rapidly below about 120K 
- The R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> of SiC devices do not deteriorate until about 220K 
- The effective R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> of Si IGBTs gets worse with reducing temperature

# Best Switches for Cryogenic Operation 

- Our work show that the GaN Systems HV Schottky p-GaN gate HEMTs offer the best performance to-date 
 - Low variability between samples, reliable operation under thermal cycling, relatively easier to design cooling, better power handling, etc.
 - Good thermal management is still very important

# Core Loss Measurement

- Used a modified partial/full cancellation methods to extract core losses 
 - Tested laminated steel, iron powder, ferrite and nanocrystalline cores
- Tests were conducted at 295K (room temperature) and 77K (using an LN2 bath)
 - A power amplifier drives the test setup and C<sub>p</sub> help reduce VA requirement

# Nanocrystalline Core Comparison (PI)

- Not all nanocrystalline core types behaves the same 
 - Introducing an air-gap in the core increases core loss
 - Production technique and core structure has a significant impact

.center[<img src="img/devices/ucore_toroid_ferrite_ribbon.png" height="350px">]

---
name: S12

# Nanocrystalline Core Comparison (PII)

- U cores have significantly higher losses in comparison to toroidal cores 
- In toroidal cores, the size and the production technique impacts the losses
 - Stress annealed cores perform the best
 - Crushed nanocrystalline cores have slightly higher losses in comparison to stress annealed cores 
 - Core height increases the losses due to increased eddy current effects

# Improved Magnetics

- Shorter toroidal cores can be stacked with an air-gaps between them to reduce eddy current losses

# A Cryogenic Converter

- A GaN based synchronous buck converter that can operate in cryogenic temperatures has been built
 - All components except the controller were operated at cryogenic temperatures
- Helps identify advantages and drawbacks of operating at cryogenic temperatures  
 - Compared with operation at 295K including a loss breakdown

# Converter with Gen 2 Magnetics

- Experiments considered nanocrystalline inductor operation in 77K and 295K
 - This enabled comparison with a ferrite inductor that operated at 295K
- As expected the nanocrystalline inductor leads to slightly lower efficiency
 - However, it allows over 70% reduction in weight

.center[<img src="img/gan/efficiency.png" height="250px">]

---
name: S19

# Loss Breakdown

- An air-core inductor is used to extract switch losses and compare 
 - A significant improvement in switch loss is observed at 77K
- Though a ferrite core inductor is more efficient there is a significant weight penalty 
 - The Gen 2 nanocrystalline core allows over 70% reduction in weight

.center[<img src="img/gan/lossComp.png" height="250px">]


---
name: S19

# Converter with Gen 3 Magnetics

- The Gen 3 magnetic design with stacked stress annealed NC cores offers similar performance to the ferrite core inductor 
 - However the Gen 3 design is 2% of the volume and weight of a traditional ferrite core inductor 
 - In this 3 kW converter, the Gen 3 inductor was only 130 g, thus providing a viable scalable design for cryogenic magnetics

 - Need significant improvements to the design to effectively operate in a vacuum

# Impact of Thermal Cycling

- Samples with pre-existing surface features were cycled between 340K to 80K
- Atomic force microscopy used to look for evidence of heterostructure degradation
- Proportion of sample area which is occupied by fissures (averaged over 5 scans) used as a metric
 - This was measured using FIJI, by segmenting the atomic force microscopy images
- No significant change which suggests repeated thermal cycling does not damage the heterostructure

# Annealing to Help Ohmic Contacts

- The behavior of contacts to p-GaNs have been investigated at cryogenic temperatures
 - Findings show Schottky behavior at cryogenic temperatures for both indium contacts and Ni-Au processed contacts​
- Annealing at higher temperatures for longer seems to help

 - V<sub>DS(ON)</sub> is sampled using an on-board MCU 
- Based on our initial findings a measurement protocol has been developed

# Research Challenges 

- Fully cryogenic power conversion system
 - We are in the process of developing a new generation of our GaN HEMT based power conversion modules, with integrated isolation, protection, ancillary services and digital control 
- Conduction cooling the converters
 - We are investigating new designs that enable conduction cooling for a power conversion system in a vacuum chamber using a cold head
- Reliability of components and further component characterization
 - Further investigation on failure modes, cold starts, impact of thermal cycling, thermal shock, thermal gradients, mechanical stresses introduced by encapsulating materials, etc.
 - Radiation hardness of cryo-cooled GaN HEMTs (possible collaboration with Airbus and STM)
- Driving a fully HTS machine 
 - Challenges involved in minimizing AC losses, insulation breakdown, low winding inductance, EMI, etc.
 - We are investigating some novel approaches to solve some of these issues
