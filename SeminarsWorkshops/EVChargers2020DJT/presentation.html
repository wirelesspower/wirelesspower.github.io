# Plug-in vs Wireless Charging

.center[<img src="img/WPT.png" height="160px">]

- Wireless chargers are convinient and provide a ubiquitous connection between EVs and the grid
 - Ideal for autonomous vehicles and V2G services
- Plug-in chargers are cheaper, have higher power density and employ mature technology
 - Provide an economical and reliable solution
- Wireless chargers are safer under harsh weather and usage 
 - Can operate safely under rainy/snowy/dusty/etc conditions 
- Wired chargers do not generate strong fields 
 - Wireless chargers require FOD and LOP circuitry to ensure safety during operation

---

# Components of a Wireless Charger

.center[<img src="img/IPTConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- Primary consists of a DC-AC switched-mode converter, a compensation network and a transmitter coil(s) 
 - A lumped transmitter coil is often referred to as a primary pad/coil/coupler 
 - An elongated coil is often called a primary track
 - Can be directly fed by a DC-bus or through a grid-connected AC-DC converter
- Secondary/pick-up consists of a receiver coil(s), a compensation network and an AC-DC converter
 - The reciever coil is is often referred to as a secondary/pick-up pad/coil/coupler
- Primary and pick-up coils are magnetically coupled but the coupling coefficient is typically less than 40%
- The compensation networks help improve efficiency by minimizing the VA requirements of converters

---

# Current Status of Wireless Chargers

- Uni or bi-directional power flow
 - Primary may use a full-bridge, half-bridge, push-pull, multi-level or matrix based converter topology
 - Pick-up may use a boost, buck, full-bridge, half-bridge or push-pull topology
 - Control techniques that facilitate ZVS/ZCS over a wide range of conditions
 - Compensation for both sides is provided through series, parallel or a combination of series-parallel tuned networks
- Power ratings up to tens of kWs
 - Magnetic designs include circular coil, solenoidal coil, polarised coil, multi coil structures as well as track based systems 
 - Ferrites and/or reflection coils are often used to shape the magnetic fields generated
 - Transmission range of over 400 mm with over Â± 200 mm XY tolerance
 - Efficiency typically over 85% but can be as high as 97%
 - Operating frequency typically ranges from tens of kHz to tens of MHz

---

# Components of a Plug-in Charger

.center[<img src="img/PGConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- A PFC stage, a grid-tie inverter or a DC-bus utilised to interface with the grid
- Safety isolation through high-frequency transformer preferred, specially in fast and extreme fast chargers
 - Hard-switched, soft-siwtched or resonant converter topologies are employed to implement the DC-DC converter  
 - LLC and series resonant converters are common in uni-directional systems
 - DABs are common in bi-directional systems
- Integrated on-board charger designs, which reuse components of the traction system has been proposed

---

# LLC Resonant Converter

.center[<img src="img/LLCConc.png" height="175px">]

- One of the most popular topologies used in isolated DC-DC converters
 - Higher efficiency and power density
- The full-bridge converter generates a square-wave `\(V_{pi}\)` at a frequency close to the resonance between `\(L_{pi}\)` and `\(C_{pi}\)` 
 - Output typically regulated through controlling the switching frequency
 - Designed to operate in the inductive region to ensure soft-switching

---

# Series Resonant Converter

.center[<img src="img/SRConc.png" height="175px">]

- A popular and simple topology used in isolated DC-DC converters
 - Good efficiency
- The full-bridge converter generates a `\(V_{pi}\)` at a frequency close to the resonance between `\(L_{pi}\)` and `\(C_{pi}\)`
 - Output typically regulated through controlling the switching frequency and/or phase-shift modulation
 - Designed to soft-switch under a range of loading conditions

---

# Dual Active Bridge 

.center[<img src="img/DABConc.png" height="175px">]

- A popular topology used in isolated bi-directional DC-DC converters
 - `\(L_{pi}\)` can be the leakage indutance of the isolation transformer
- The full-bridge converters generate `\(V_{pi}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` typically at a fixed frequency `\(f_{s}\)`
 - Designed to soft-switch under a range of loading conditions
 - VA requirements of the full-bridges must be minimised
- Typically the amplitudes of `\(V_{pi}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` as well as the phase-angle, `\(\theta\)`, between them are controlled to regulate the power flow

---

# Control of DAB

.center[<img src="img/PShiftGen.png" height="230px">]

- Each leg of a full-bridge operated at 50% duty-cycle, generating for example the square-waves `\(v_{pa}\)` and `\(v_{pb}\)`
 - The phase-shift modulation, `\(\phi_{p}\)`, applied between `\(v_{pa}\)` and `\(v_{pb}\)`, regulates the magnitude of the fundamental component of `\(v_{pi}\)`, since `\(v_{pi}=v_{pa}-v_{pb}\)`
- Phase-shift modulation applied to each converter as well as phase-angle of `\(V_{si}\)` with respect to `\(V_{pi}\)` is used to regulate the power flow magnitude and direction while minimising losses

---

# Modelling a DAB

.left-column[
- Noting that `\( \omega_s = 2 \pi f_s\)`, `\(v_{pi}\)` and `\(v_{si}\)` can be given by
\\[ v\_{pi} = V\_{in} \frac {4} {\pi} \sum\_{m=1,3,..}^{\infty} \frac {\sin \left(  m \phi\_p/2 \right)} {m} \sin \left(  m \omega\_s t \right)  \quad  \\]
\\[ v\_{si} = V\_{out} \frac {4} {\pi} \sum\_{m=1,3,..}^{\infty} \frac {\sin \left(  m \phi\_s/2 \right)} {m} \sin \left(  m \omega\_s t + m \theta  \right)  \quad  \\]
- Power transferred to the load is therefore
\\[ P\_{o} = \frac {-8V\_{in}V\_{out}} {N \pi^2 \omega\_s L\_{pi(eq)}}  \sin \left( \theta \right) \sin \left(  \phi\_p/2 \right) \sin \left(  \phi\_s/2 \right) \\]

# LCL Resonant Dual Active Bridge

 - `\(L_{pt}\)` can compose of the leakage indutance of the isolation transformer

- The full-bridge converters generate `\(V_{pi}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` typically at a fixed frequency `\(f_{s}\)` close to the resonant frequency of the LCL network
 - Designed to soft-switch under a range of loading conditions
- Typically the amplitudes of `\(V_{pi}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` as well as the phase-angle, `\(\theta\)`, between them are controlled to regulate the power flow

---

# Control of LCL-RDAB

- Phase-shift modulation applied to each converter as well as phase-angle of `\(V_{si}\)` with respect to `\(V_{pi}\)` is used to regulate the power flow magnitude and direction while minimising losses
- Alternatively, the duty-cycle modulation applied, can be used to regulate the magnitude `\(V_{pi}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` 
 - For example, since `\(v_{pi}=v_{pa}-v_{pb}\)`, when `\(v_{pa}\)` and `\(v_{pb}\)` are `\(180^0\)` out of phase `\(D_{p}\)` controls magnitude of `\(V_{pi}\)`
 - When `\(D_{p} = 50\%\)`, `\(V_{pi}\)` is a maximum

- Noting that `\(\phi_{p/s} \equiv 2 \pi (1-D_{p/s}) \textrm{ or } 2 \pi D_{p/s} \)`, bridge currents are
\\[ i\_{pi} = \frac {4V\_{out}} {N \pi \omega\_s L\_{pt(eq)}} \sin \left(  \phi\_s/2 \right) \cos \left( \omega\_s t + \theta  \right) \\]
