# Components of an IPT System


.center[<img src="img/fund/IPTConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- Primary consists of a DC-AC switched-mode converter, a compensation network and a transmitter coil(s) 
 - A lumped transmitter coil is often referred to as a primary pad/coil/coupler 
 - An elongated coil is often called a primary track
 - Can be directly fed by a DC source or through a grid-connected AC-DC converter
- Secondary/pick-up consists of a reciever coil(s), a compensation network and an AC-DC converter
 - The reciever coil is is often referred to as a secondary/pick-up pad/coil/coupler
- Primary and pick-up coils are magnetically coupled but the coupling coefficient is less than 40%
- The compensation networks help improve efficiency by minimizing the VA requirements of converters

---
name: S8

# Current Status

- Uni or bi-directional power flow
 - Primary may use a full-bridge, half-bridge, push-pull, multi-level or matrix based converter topology
 - Pick-up may use a boost, buck, full- or half-bridge and push-pull topology
 - Control techniques that facilitate ZVS/ZCS over a wide range of conditions
 - Compensation for both sides is provided through series, parallel or a combination of series-parallel tuned networks
- Power ratings up to tens of kWs
 - Magnetic designs include circular coil, solenoidal coil, polarised coil, multi coil structures as well as track based systems 
 - Ferrites and/or reflections coils often used to shape the magnetic fields generated
 - Transmission range of over 400 mm with over Â± 200 mm XY tolerance
 - Efficiency typically over 85% but can be as high as 97%
 - Operating frequency typically range from tens of kHz to tens of MHz

# Modelling the Primary and Pick-up Coils

.center[<img src="img/fund/TxEq.png" height="140px">]

- The behaviour of the coils can be modelled using a T equivelent transformer model
 - `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils
 - `\(\phi_{m}\)` represents flux linkage while `\(\phi_{lk_p}\)` and `\(\phi_{lk_s}\)` represent leakage flux
 - The coupling coefficient, k, between the coils is less than 0.4 in a typical IPT system
- The mutual inductance, M, between the two coils is given by 
\\[M = k\sqrt{L\_{pt}L\_{st}}\\]
- The turns ratio, n, is related to the self-inductances of the coils since,  `\(n = \frac{N_{pt}}{N_{st}} = \sqrt{\frac{L_{pt}}{L_{st}}}\)`

---
name: S10

# Measuring Self-inductance 

.center[<img src="img/fund/OcTst.png" height="140px">]

- The self-inductance of primary coil is obtained by measuring inductance seen from primary when pick-up coil is open-circuited since 
\\[L\_{pt(oc)} = (1-k)L\_{pt}+kL\_{pt}=L\_{pt}\\]
- Similarly the self-inductance of pick-up coil can also be measured
- Depending on the construction of the coils, the self-inductance may change with changes in relative displacement between the coils


---
name: S11

# Measuring Coupling Coefficient

.center[<img src="img/fund/ScTst.png" height="140px">]

- The inductance seen from primary when pick-up coil is short-circuited is related to `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(k\)` as given by 
\\[L\_{pt(sc)} = (1-k)L\_{pt}+\frac{k(1-k)L\_{pt}^2}{kL\_{pt}+(1-k)L\_{pt}} = (1-k^2)L\_{pt}\\]
- The coupling coefficient between the coils can be calculated from measured `\(L_{pt(oc)}\)` and `\(L_{pt(sc)}\)` using
\\[k = \sqrt{\frac{L\_{pt(oc)}-L\_{pt(sc)}}{L\_{pt(oc)}}}\\]

---
name: S12

# Coupled Inductor Model

.center[<img src="img/fund/CpldL.png" height="135px">]

- Although a T equivelent transformer model can be used to model the coils, the coupled inductor model is widely used when analysing an IPT system in the phasor domain
- In the coupled inductor model, `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` represent the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils
- `\(V_{sr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{st}\)` due to current `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` flowing through `\(L_{pt}\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- Similarly, `\(V_{pr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{pt}\)` due to `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{pr} = \omega MI\_{st}e^{j(\theta+\pi/2)}\\]

---
name: S13

# Open-Circuit Voltage & Short-Circuit Current

.left-column[
- The voltage measured across an open-circuited pick-up coil, `\(V_{oc}\)`, is the same as `\(V_{sr}\)` and therefore
\\[V\_{oc} = V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- The current flowing through a short-circuited pick-up coil, `\(I_{sc}\)`, is 
\\[I\_{sc} = \frac{V\_{sr}}{j\omega L\_{st}} = I\_{pt}\frac{M}{L\_{st}}\\]
- The uncompensated volt-ampere (VA) capacity of the pick-up coil can be given by
\\[S\_{u} = \left | V\_{oc} \right | \left | I\_{sc} \right | = I\_{pt}^2\frac{\omega M^2}{L\_{st}}\\]
]

.right-column[.right[

---
name: S14

# Power Transferred Across Airgap

.left-column[
- Assume that the `\(V_{sr}\)` induced by `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` causes a current `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` to flow through a load, `\(Z_{sc}\)`, attached across the pick-up coil 
- Under these conditions power transferred across the airgap can be given by
\\[P\_{o} = \Re \left \\{ V\_{sr}I\_{st}e^{-j(\theta)} \right \\} = \left | V\_{sr} \right | \left | I\_{st} \right | \cos(\pi/2-\theta)\\]
- The VA rating of the coils required to achieve this is
\\[\mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \omega L\_{pt} \left | I\_{pt} \right |^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \mathit{VA}\_{st} = \omega L\_{st} \left | I\_{st} \right |^2 \\]
- Thus `\(P_{o}\)` is related to the VA in the coils as given by
\\[P\_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}\mathit{VA}\_{st}} \sin(\theta) \\]

]

name: S15

# Coil Q & Losses

- Assume that the losses in `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are modelled using equivelent series resistances (ESRs) `\(r_{pt}\)` and `\(r_{st}\)`
- The quality factors, `\(Q_{pt}\)` and `\(Q_{st}\)`, of the primary and pick-up coils are
\\[Q\_{pt} =  {\omega L\_{pt}}/{r\_{pt}} \quad \text{and} \quad Q\_{st} = {\omega L\_{st}} / {r\_{st}} \\]
- The total losses in the two coils can be expressed as
\\[P\_{loss(c)} = \left | I\_{pt}^2 \right | r\_{pt} + \left | I\_{st}^2 \right | r\_{st} = \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}}{Q\_{pt}} + \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{st}}{Q\_{st}}\\]
- Since `\(P_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}_{pt}\mathit{VA}_{st}} \sin(\theta) \)`, `\(P_{loss(c)}\)` can be expressed as
\\[P\_{loss(c)} = \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}}{Q\_{pt}} + \frac{P\_{o}^2}{\mathit{VA}\_{pt} k^2 Q\_{st} \sin(\theta)^2}\\]

---
name: S16

# Maximum Coil-Coil Efficiency

- Taking the derivative of `\(P_{loss(c)}\)`, conditions to achieve minimum loss can be derived as
\\[ \mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \frac {P\_{o}} {k} \sqrt { \frac {Q\_{pt}} {Q\_{st}} } \quad \text{or} \quad \mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \frac {Q\_{pt}} {Q\_{st}} \mathit{VA}\_{st} \sin(\theta)^2 \\]
- Under above conditions losses in `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are a minimum and can be given by
\\[ P\_{loss(c)\_{min}} = \frac {2 P\_{o}} {k \sin(\theta)} \frac {1} {\sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} } \\]
- Thus the maximum coil-coil power transfer efficiency can be derived as
\\[ \eta\_{c\_{max}} = \frac{ k \sin(\theta) -  \frac {1} { \sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} {k \sin(\theta) +  \frac {1} {\sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} \\]

# Example: Simulating the Coils

When placed `\(100 mm\)` apart the primary and pick-up coils of an IPT system each measures `\(18.73 \mu H\)` (measured when the other coil is open circuited). The primary coil measured `\(18.5427 \mu H\)` when the pick-up coil was short-circuited. The primary coil of the IPT system is driven by the primary power supply through a compensation network to maintain a `\(85 kHz\)`, `\(10 A_{rms}\)` current. 

.left-column[
- Show that the `\(k\)` between the two coils is 0.1
- Develop a simulation model on LTSpice 
- With the aid of this model show that `\(V_{oc}=10V_{rms}\)` and `\(I_{sc}=1A_{rms}\)`
- Show that the coils can be modelled using the inductance matrix
\\[ \begin{bmatrix} L\_{pt} & M \\\ M & L\_{st} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 18.73 & 1.873 \\\ 1.873 & 18.73 \end{bmatrix} \mu H \\]

 - Changes to `\(k\)` between the coils 
 - Changes to `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` of the coils
- With lateral/longitudinal displacement `\(k\)` will drop to 0
 - The point at which `\(k\)` drops to 0 is referred to as the decoupled position of the coils

# An Uncompesated Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/comp/UncompR.png" height="135px">]

- Assume a load resistor, `\(R_{L}\)`, is connected directly across a pick-up coil, which is coupled with a primary coil 
- The primary coil is driven by the primary converter generating a current `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` at an angular frequency `\(\omega = 2\pi f\)`
- The current flowing through pick-up coil as well as the load will be
\\[ I\_{st} = \frac {-V\_{sr}} {R\_{L} + j\omega L\_{st}} = \frac {-\omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}} {R\_{L} + j\omega L\_{st}}  \\]


---

# Power from an Uncompesated Pick-up

.left-column[
- The power delivered to the load is then
\\[ P\_{o} =  \left | I\_{st} \right |^2 R\_{L} = \left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2  \frac {R\_{L}} {R\_{L}^2 + \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 } = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {\omega L\_{st} / R\_{L}} { 1 + \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 / R\_{L}^2 } \\]
- At a load `\(R_L = \omega L_{st}\)`, maximum power is delivered 
\\[ P\_{o\_{(max)}} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2} {2 \omega L\_{st} } = 0.5 V\_{oc}I\_{sc}  = 0.5k^2\mathit{VA}\_{pt} \\]
- As an example, when `\(k = 0.1\)`, to deliver 5 mW to the load, the primary coil should be driven atleast at 1 VA
 - The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` limits the power transfer

# A Series Compensated Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/comp/SCompR.png" height="135px">]

- The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` can be compensated using the capacitor `\(C_{st}\)` that is connected in series with `\(L_{st}\)`
- To allow the pick-up to behave like an ideal voltage source, at a given `\(\omega\)`, `\(C_{st}\)` can be selected such that 
\\[ \omega L\_{st} = \frac {1} {\omega C\_{st}} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{st}C\_{st}} } \\]
- The impedance of the compensated pick-up, including `\(R_{L}\)`, seen from `\(V_{sr}\)` is given by
\\[ Z\_{s} = j \left ( \omega L\_{st} - \frac {1} {\omega C\_{st}} \right ) + R\_{L} = j \Delta \omega L\_{st} + R\_{L} \quad \text{when} \quad L\_{st} \rightarrow (1 + \Delta) L\_{st} \\]


---

# Power Transfer with Series Compensation

.left-column[
- Assuming `\( L_{st} \rightarrow (1+\Delta) L_{st} \)` to account for detuning introduced by changes to `\(L_{st} \)`, output power can be obtained as
\\[ P\_{o} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 R\_{L}} { \Delta^2 \omega^2 L\_{st}^2  + R\_{L}^2 }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {(1+ \Delta) \omega L\_{st} / R\_{L}} { 1 + \Delta^2 \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 / R\_{L}^2 } \\]
- If perfectly tuned (i.e. `\(\Delta = 0\)`) output power increases with `\(1/R_L\)`
\\[ P\_{o} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 } { R\_{L} }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {\omega L\_{st}} {R\_{L} } \\]
- When detuned (i.e. `\(\Delta \neq 0\)`) maximum output power is limited to 
\\[ P\_{o\_{(max)}} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 } { 2 \Delta \omega L\_{st} }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {1+ \Delta} {2 \Delta } \quad \text{at} \quad R\_{L} = \Delta \omega L\_{st}\\]

# Example: Series Compensated Pick-up

When placed `\(100 mm\)` apart the primary and pick-up coils of an IPT system each measures `\(18.73 \mu H\)`. `\(k\)` between the two coils is measured as 10%. `\(L_{pt}\)` is driven to maintain a constant `\(85 kHz\)`, `\(10 A_{rms}\)` current. The pick-up uses series compensation and power a `\(2 \Omega \)` AC load.

# Partial Series Compensation of Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/comp/PartialSCompR.png" height="135px">]

- At a given `\(k\)` and a primary excitation, `\(\mathit{VA_{pt}}\)`, the power transfered to the load of a parallel or LCL compensated pick-up is determined by `\(R_L/\omega L_{st}\)`
- If `\(R_L\)` is fixed by the design and there is little or no flexibility to change `\(L_{st}\)`, then `\(L_{st}\)` can be partially compensated using the series connected capacitor, `\(C_{si}\)`, to increase the power output to a desired value
 - Essentially, partially series compensation increases `\(\mathit{VA_{st}}\)` to increase `\(P_o\)`
- The equivalent inductance of the partially compensated pick-up coil, which can be used to calculate `\(C_{st}\)` (and `\(L_{si}\)` in the case of an LCL compensated pick-up) is given by
\\[ L\_{st\_{{(eq)}}} = L\_{st} - 1/ \left(  \omega^2 C\_{si} \right)  \\]

# Operating Quality Factor of a Pick-up

- `\(P_o\)` of a series compensated pick-up was proportional to `\(\omega L_{st}/R_L\)` while for a parallel/LCL compensated pick-up `\(P_o\)` was proportional to `\(R_L/\omega L_{st}\)`
- The ratio `\(\omega L_{st}/R_L\)` or `\(R_L/\omega L_{st}\)`, is referred to as the operating quality factor of a pick-up and thus when operated at a load `\(R_L\)`, the operating quality factor of a series compensated pick-up, `\(Q_{ss_{(op)}}\)`, or the operating quality factor of a parallel/LCL compensated pick-up, `\(Q_{sp_{(op)}}\)`, can be given by
 \\[ Q\_{ss\_{{(op)}}} = \frac {\omega L\_{st} } {R\_L} \quad \text{or} \quad Q\_{sp\_{{(op)}}} = \frac {R\_L} {\omega L\_{st} } \\]
- A higher operating `\(Q\)` results in higher power but also makes the pick-up increasingly sensitive to changes
 - As an example, from previous analysis, if operated at a `\(Q_{ss_{(op)}}\)` of 5, a 20% change in `\(L_{st}\)` results in a 50% drop in `\(P_o\)`
 - Typically, an IPT system is designed to have an operating `\(Q\)` of less than 10 
- Note that `\(Q_{pt}\)` and `\(Q_{st}\)` are a measure of the coil quality and it is therefore desirable to for these to be much larger than the operating `\(Q\)`

# Reflected Impedance on to Primary

.center[<img src="img/netw/RefImp.png" height="135px">]

- The pick-up can be modelled as `\(V_{sr}\)` driving into `\(Z_s\)`, which models the pick-up compensation and the load
- Current flowing through the pick-up coil is therefore 
\\[ I\_{st} = -V\_{pr} / Z\_s = -j \omega M I\_{pt} / Z\_s \\]
- `\(I_{st}\)` induces a voltage, `\(V_{pr}\)`, across the primary coil, which can be given by
\\[ V\_{pr} = j \omega M I\_{st} = \omega^2 M^2 I\_{pt} / Z\_s \\]
- `\(V_{pr}\)` can also be represented as a reflected impedance where `\(Z_{pr} = \omega^2 M^2 / Z_s \)`

---

# Primary Compensation Networks

.center[<img src="img/netw/PCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- Directly driving the highly inductive load consisting of `\(L_{st}\)` and `\(Z_{pr}\)` with a power converter can be very inefficiency and costly
 - For example the VA rating of the converter, which is required to deliver `\(1W\)` to the pick-up load, can be in excess of `\(1/(k^2Q_{ss/sp_{(op)}})\)`
- Compensation networks are used to reduce the VA demand of the primary converter
- A series or an LCL compensation network is commonly employed if the primary is driven by a voltage source inverter  
- A parallel compensation network is commonly employed if the primary is driven by a current source inverter

# A Series Compensated Primary (PI)

.center[<img src="img/netw/PCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- The impedance of `\(L_{pt}\)` can be compensated using the capacitor `\(C_{pt}\)` that is connected in series with `\(L_{pt}\)`
- At a given `\(\omega\)`, `\(C_{pt}\)` can be selected to negate the impedance of `\(L_{pt}\)` by ensuring
\\[ \omega L\_{pt} = \frac {1} {\omega C\_{pt}} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{pt}C\_{pt}} } \\]
- The impedance of the compensated primary, including `\(V_{pr}\)`, seen by the converter is given by
\\[ Z\_{p} = j \left ( \omega L\_{pt} - \frac {1} {\omega C\_{pt}} \right ) + \frac {\omega^2 M^2} {Z\_s} = j \Delta\_p \omega L\_{pt} + \frac {\omega^2 M^2} {Z\_s} \quad \text{when} \quad L\_{pt} \rightarrow (1 + \Delta\_p) L\_{pt} \\]

# A Series Compensated Primary (PII)

.center[<img src="img/netw/PCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- When `\(C_{pt}\)` is designed to fully compensate `\(L_{pt}\)`, the primary converter drives an impedance
\\[ Z\_{p} = \omega^2 M^2 / Z\_s \\]
- In a typical IPT system, the pick-up compensation network ensures that `\(Z_{s}\)` is mostly resistive 
 - For example, in an ideally series compensated pick-up `\(Z_{s} = R_L\)`
- As such, when series compensated, the primary converter only has to supply the load current 
\\[ I\_{pi} = \frac {V\_{pi}} {Z\_p} = \frac {V\_{pi}} {j \Delta\_p \omega L\_{pt} + \omega^2 M^2 / Z\_s} \\]
