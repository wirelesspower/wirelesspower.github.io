# Wireless Power Transfer

- Can be divided in to two broad categories
- Radiative transmission through far-field principles
 - Examples include power transfer through radio-frequency, microwave, optical and ultrasonic technologies
 - At an experimental stage of development
 - Start-up companies such as ubeam, energous, WI-Charge, etc. are working in this space
 - AirFuel Alliance is developing standards
- Non-radiative transmission through near-field principles
 - Inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) technologies are utilised
 - IPT is the most mature technology as it has been used in industrial applications since the 90s
 - A number of companies such as Daifuku, Conductix Wampfler, Apple, WitriCity, Bombardier, Wave IPT etc. are working in this space
 - WPC, SAE, etc. standards are being developed

---

# IPT Applications

- Factory automation and materials handling
 - Includes hoists, AGVs and clean room systems  
- Consumer electronics and appliances
 - Charging phones, laptops, etc. as well as powering appliances 
- Transportation electrification 
 - Charging stationary and in-motion electric vehicles, charging electric ferries, etc.
- Biomedical
 - Charging and powering medical devices as well as implants
- Lighting and industrial applications  
 - Provides wireless power and communication to applications such as tunnel lighting, mining, industrial machinery, robots, etc. 

---

# Components of an IPT System

.center[<img src="img/IPTConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- Primary consists of a DC-AC switched-mode converter, a compensation network and a transmitter coil(s) 
 - A lumped transmitter coil is often referred to as a primary pad/coil/coupler 
 - An elongated coil is often called a primary track
 - Can be directly fed by a DC source or through a grid-connected AC-DC converter
- Secondary/pick-up consists of a receiver coil(s), a compensation network and an AC-DC converter
 - The reciever coil is is often referred to as a secondary/pick-up pad/coil/coupler
- Primary and pick-up coils are magnetically coupled but the coupling coefficient is typically less than 40%
- The compensation networks help improve efficiency by minimizing the VA requirements of converters

---

# Current Status

- Uni or bi-directional power flow
 - Primary may use a full-bridge, half-bridge, push-pull, multi-level or matrix based converter topology
 - Pick-up may use a boost, buck, full-bridge, half-bridge or push-pull topology
 - Control techniques that facilitate ZVS/ZCS over a wide range of conditions
 - Compensation for both sides is provided through series, parallel or a combination of series-parallel tuned networks
- Power ratings up to tens of kWs
 - Magnetic designs include circular coil, solenoidal coil, polarised coil, multi coil structures as well as track based systems 
 - Ferrites and/or reflection coils are often used to shape the magnetic fields generated
 - Transmission range of over 400 mm with over Â± 200 mm XY tolerance
 - Efficiency typically over 85% but can be as high as 97%
 - Operating frequency typically ranges from tens of kHz to tens of MHz

---

# Coupled Inductor Model

.center[<img src="img/CpldL.png" height="135px">]

- Although a T equivalent transformer model can be used to model the coils, the coupled inductor model is widely used when analysing an IPT system in the phasor-domain
- In the coupled inductor model, `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` represent the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils
- `\(V_{sr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{st}\)` due to current `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` flowing through `\(L_{pt}\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- Similarly, `\(V_{pr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{pt}\)` due to `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{pr} = \omega MI\_{st}e^{j(\theta+\pi/2)}\\]

---

# Open-Circuit Voltage & Short-Circuit Current

.left-column[
- The voltage measured across an open-circuited pick-up coil, `\(V_{oc}\)`, is the same as `\(V_{sr}\)` and therefore
\\[V\_{oc} = V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- The current flowing through a short-circuited pick-up coil, `\(I_{sc}\)`, is 
\\[I\_{sc} = \frac{V\_{sr}}{j\omega L\_{st}} = I\_{pt}\frac{M}{L\_{st}}\\]
- The uncompensated volt-ampere (VA) capacity of the pick-up coil can be given by
\\[S\_{u} = \left | V\_{oc} \right | \left | I\_{sc} \right | = I\_{pt}^2\frac{\omega M^2}{L\_{st}}\\]
]

.right-column[.right[
<img src="img/VocIsc.png" width="310px">
]]

---

# Power Transferred Across Airgap

.left-column[
- Assume that the `\(V_{sr}\)` induced by `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` causes a current `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` to flow through a load, `\(Z_{sc}\)`, attached across the pick-up coil 
- Under these conditions, power transferred across the airgap can be given by
\\[P\_{o} = \Re \left \\{ V\_{sr}I\_{st}e^{-j(\theta)} \right \\} = \left | V\_{sr} \right | \left | I\_{st} \right | \cos(\pi/2-\theta)\\]
- The VA rating of the coils required to achieve this is
\\[\mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \omega L\_{pt} \left | I\_{pt} \right |^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \mathit{VA}\_{st} = \omega L\_{st} \left | I\_{st} \right |^2 \\]
- Thus `\(P_{o}\)` is related to the VA in the coils as given by
\\[P\_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}\mathit{VA}\_{st}} \sin(\theta) \\]

]

.right-column[.right[
<img src="img/GenP.png" width="310px">
]]

---

# Coil Q & Losses

- Assume that the losses in `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are modelled using equivelent series resistances (ESRs) `\(r_{pt}\)` and `\(r_{st}\)`
- The quality factors, `\(Q_{pt}\)` and `\(Q_{st}\)`, of the primary and pick-up coils are
\\[Q\_{pt} =  {\omega L\_{pt}}/{r\_{pt}} \quad \text{and} \quad Q\_{st} = {\omega L\_{st}} / {r\_{st}} \\]
- The total losses in the two coils can be expressed as
\\[P\_{loss(c)} = \left | I\_{pt}^2 \right | r\_{pt} + \left | I\_{st}^2 \right | r\_{st} = \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}}{Q\_{pt}} + \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{st}}{Q\_{st}}\\]
- Since `\(P_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}_{pt}\mathit{VA}_{st}} \sin(\theta) \)`, `\(P_{loss(c)}\)` can be expressed as
\\[P\_{loss(c)} = \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}}{Q\_{pt}} + \frac{P\_{o}^2}{\mathit{VA}\_{pt} k^2 Q\_{st} \sin^2(\theta)}\\]

---

# Maximum Coil-Coil Efficiency

- Taking the derivative of `\(P_{loss(c)}\)`, conditions to achieve minimum loss can be derived as
\\[ \mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \frac {P\_{o}} {k \sin(\theta)} \sqrt { \frac {Q\_{pt}} {Q\_{st}} } \quad \text{or} \quad \mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \frac {Q\_{pt}} {Q\_{st}} \mathit{VA}\_{st} \\]
- Under above conditions losses in `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are a minimum and can be given by
\\[ P\_{loss(c)\_{min}} = \frac {2 P\_{o}} {k \sin(\theta)} \frac {1} {\sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} } \\]
- Thus, the maximum coil-coil power transfer efficiency can be derived as
\\[ \eta\_{c\_{max}} = \frac{ k \sin(\theta) -  \frac {1} { \sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} {k \sin(\theta) +  \frac {1} {\sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} \\]

# Active Rectification of Pick-up Output

.center[<img src="img/ActiveSys.png" height="180px">]

- Identical primary and pick-up circuits employ inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL) T-resonant networks
 - Can use other types of compensation networks 
- Both full-bridge converters are operated at the same frequency to drive the couplers
 - Compensation networks are typically tuned to the fundamental switching frequency
- Magnitude of power flow is regulated using voltage cancellation to control the RMS of `\( V_{pi} \)` and `\( V_{si} \)` and/or controlling the phase difference between `\( V_{pi} \)` and `\( V_{si} \)`
- Direction of power flow is controlled using the phase difference, `\( \theta \)`, between `\( V_{pi} \)` and `\( V_{si} \)`
