# Components of an IPT System


.center[<img src="img/fund/IPTConcSys.png" height="150px">]

- Primary consists of a DC-AC switched-mode converter, a compensation network and a transmitter coil(s) 
 - A lumped transmitter coil is often referred to as a primary pad/coil/coupler 
 - An elongated coil is often called a primary track
 - Can be directly fed by a DC source or through a grid-connected AC-DC converter
- Secondary/pick-up consists of a receiver coil(s), a compensation network and an AC-DC converter
 - The reciever coil is is often referred to as a secondary/pick-up pad/coil/coupler
- Primary and pick-up coils are magnetically coupled but the coupling coefficient is typically less than 40%
- The compensation networks help improve efficiency by minimizing the VA requirements of converters

---
name: S7

# Current Status

- Uni or bi-directional power flow
 - Primary may use a full-bridge, half-bridge, push-pull, multi-level or matrix based converter topology
 - Pick-up may use a boost, buck, full-bridge, half-bridge or push-pull topology
 - Control techniques that facilitate ZVS/ZCS over a wide range of conditions
 - Compensation for both sides is provided through series, parallel or a combination of series-parallel tuned networks
- Power ratings up to tens of kWs
 - Magnetic designs include circular coil, solenoidal coil, polarised coil, multi coil structures as well as track based systems 
 - Ferrites and/or reflection coils are often used to shape the magnetic fields generated
 - Transmission range of over 400 mm with over Â± 200 mm XY tolerance
 - Efficiency typically over 85% but can be as high as 97%
 - Operating frequency typically ranges from tens of kHz to tens of MHz

# Modelling the Primary and Pick-up Coils

.center[<img src="img/fund/TxEq.png" height="140px">]

- The behaviour of the coils can be modelled using a T-equivelent transformer model
 - `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils, respectively
 - `\(\phi_{m}\)` represents flux linkage while `\(\phi_{lk_p}\)` and `\(\phi_{lk_s}\)` represent leakage flux
 - The coupling coefficient, k, between the coils is less than 0.4 in a typical IPT system
- The mutual inductance, M, between the two coils is given by 
\\[M = k\sqrt{L\_{pt}L\_{st}}\\]
- If the mean-turn lengths of the coils do not change, then `\(n = \frac{N_{pt}}{N_{st}} = \sqrt{\frac{L_{pt}}{L_{st}}}\)`, where `\(n\)` is the turns ratio

---
name: S9

# Coupled Inductor Model

.center[<img src="img/fund/CpldL.png" height="135px">]

- Although a T equivalent transformer model can be used to model the coils, the coupled inductor model is widely used when analysing an IPT system in the phasor-domain
- In the coupled inductor model, `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` represent the self-inductances of primary and pick-up coils
- `\(V_{sr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{st}\)` due to current `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` flowing through `\(L_{pt}\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- Similarly, `\(V_{pr}\)` represents voltage induced across `\(L_{pt}\)` due to `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` and is given by
\\[V\_{pr} = \omega MI\_{st}e^{j(\theta+\pi/2)}\\]

???

If the current through primary coil is `\(I_{pt} \sin (\omega t)\)` then,
\\[\phi\_{m} \propto I\_{pt} \sin (\omega t) \\]
The voltage induced on the pick-up coil is therefore,
\\[v\_{sr} \propto \frac{\mathrm{d} \phi\_{m} }{\mathrm{d} t} \\]
\\[v\_{sr} \propto \omega I\_{pt} \cos (\omega t) \\]
Since `\(M\)` represent the coupling between the two coils,
\\[v\_{sr} = \omega M I\_{pt} \cos (\omega t) \\]
In the phasor-domain,
\\[V\_{sr} = \omega M I\_{pt} e^{j\pi/2} \\]

---
name: S10

# Open-Circuit Voltage & Short-Circuit Current

.left-column[
- The voltage measured across an open-circuited pick-up coil, `\(V_{oc}\)`, is the same as `\(V_{sr}\)` and therefore
\\[V\_{oc} = V\_{sr} = \omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}\\]
- The current flowing through a short-circuited pick-up coil, `\(I_{sc}\)`, is 
\\[I\_{sc} = \frac{V\_{sr}}{j\omega L\_{st}} = I\_{pt}\frac{M}{L\_{st}}\\]
- The uncompensated volt-ampere (VA) capacity of the pick-up coil can be given by
\\[S\_{u} = \left | V\_{oc} \right | \left | I\_{sc} \right | = I\_{pt}^2\frac{\omega M^2}{L\_{st}}\\]
]

.right-column[.right[
<img src="img/fund/VocIsc.png" width="310px">
]]

---
name: S11

# Power Transferred Across Airgap

.left-column[
- Assume that the `\(V_{sr}\)` induced by `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` causes a current `\(I_{st}\angle\theta\)` to flow through a load, `\(Z_{sc}\)`, attached across the pick-up coil 
- Under these conditions, power transferred is
\\[P\_{o} = \Re \left \\{ V\_{sr}I\_{st}e^{-j(\theta)} \right \\} = \left | V\_{sr} \right | \left | I\_{st} \right | \cos(\pi/2-\theta)\\]
- The VA rating of the coils required to achieve this is
\\[\mathit{VA}\_{pt} = \omega L\_{pt} \left | I\_{pt} \right |^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \mathit{VA}\_{st} = \omega L\_{st} \left | I\_{st} \right |^2 \\]
- Thus `\(P_{o}\)` is related to the VA in the coils as given by
\\[P\_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}\mathit{VA}\_{st}} \sin(\theta) \\]
 - Typically, `\(\sin(\theta) \approx 1\)`, and thus `\( P_o \approx k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}_{pt}\mathit{VA}_{st}} \)`
]

.right-column[.right[
<img src="img/fund/GenP.png" width="310px">
]]

???

Note that 
\\[P\_{o} = \Re \left \\{ V\_{sr} \bar {I\_{st}} \right \\} \\]
Substituting `\( \left| V_{sr} \right | = \omega M \left| I_{pt} \right | \)`, 
\\[P\_{o} = \omega M \left | I\_{pt} \right | \left | I\_{st} \right | \cos(\pi/2-\theta)\\]
\\[P\_{o} = k\sqrt{ (\omega L\_{pt} \left | I\_{pt} \right |^2 ) (\omega L\_{st} \left | I\_{st} \right |^2) } \sin(\theta)\\]
\\[P\_{o} = k \sqrt{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}\mathit{VA}\_{st}} \sin(\theta) \\]

name: S12

# Coil Q, Losses & Maximum Efficiency

- Assume that the losses in `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` are modelled using equivelent series resistances (ESRs) `\(r_{pt}\)` and `\(r_{st}\)`
- The quality factors, `\(Q_{pt}\)` and `\(Q_{st}\)`, of the primary and pick-up coils are
\\[Q\_{pt} =  {\omega L\_{pt}}/{r\_{pt}} \quad \text{and} \quad Q\_{st} = {\omega L\_{st}} / {r\_{st}} \\]
- The total losses in the two coils can be expressed as
\\[P\_{loss(c)} = \left | I\_{pt}^2 \right | r\_{pt} + \left | I\_{st}^2 \right | r\_{st} = \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{pt}}{Q\_{pt}} + \frac{\mathit{VA}\_{st}}{Q\_{st}}\\]
- The maximum efficiency is achieved when losses in the coils are matched (i.e. `\(\mathit{VA}_{pt}/Q_{pt} = \mathit{VA}_{st}/Q_{st}\)` )
\\[ \eta\_{c\_{max}} = \frac{ k \sin(\theta) -  \frac {1} { \sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} {k \sin(\theta) +  \frac {1} {\sqrt {Q\_{pt} Q\_{st}} }} \\]

# Types of Coil Structures

.center[<img src="img/coils/CoilGen.png" height="150px">]

- Can be broadly divided into ditributed track type coil structures and lumped coil structures
- Typically, ferrites are used to help shape the field generated 
 - Maximize coupling, minimize leakage and improve coil Q
- As an alternative for ferrites, energised or passive field shapping coils can be used
- Lumped coil structures can be further divided as non-polarised, polarised and multi-coil structures
- Multi-coil structures typically employ multiple decoupled coils 
 - Each coil can be driven seperately to create the desired field pattern
- Repeater coils can be used to extend the range 

---
name: S14

# Construction of a Lumped Coil

.left-column[
- Contructed as planar spiral winding and take the shape of a circle/square/rectangle/etc.
 - Multifilar windings can be used to increase the current rating, but special attention is required to ensure current sharing 
- High-frequency Litz wire is used to improve coil Q
 - Need to ensure that the windings are appropriately isolated 
- Ferrite plates/disks/bars are used to create a single sided flux pattern 
- The housing that provides electrical isolation holds the Litz wire and the ferrites 
 - Typically the windings and ferrites are potted 
- Aluminum shielding is used to reduce leakage flux

# Non-Polarised Coils

.left-column[
- The single sided magnetic field distribution is from centre to edge of the coil
- Typically used to transfer power over a gap that is roughly equivalent to one quarter of the coil diameter
- Changes in the displacement between the primary and pick-up coils causes
 - Changes to `\(k\)` between the coils 
 - Changes to `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` of the coils
- With lateral/longitudinal displacement `\(k\)` will drop to 0
 - The point at which `\(k\)` drops to 0 is referred to as the decoupled position of the coils
 - A negative `\(k\)` after the decoupled position indicates a `\(180^0\)` phase-shift in induced voltage

# DD Type Polarised Coils

.left-column[
- The single sided magnetic field distribution is from one end to the other end of the coil
- Typically used to transfer power over a gap that is roughly equivalent to one half of the coil length
- Flux-pipe formed by the two coils at the center of the pad should be as large as possible
- Changes in the displacement between the primary and pick-up coils causes
 - Changes to `\(k\)` between the coils 
 - Changes to `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{st}\)` of the coils
- With longitudinal (x) displacement `\(k\)` will drop to 0
 - At the point at which `\(k\)` drops to 0, primary and pick-up DD coils are decoupled

# Multi Coil Structures


.center[<img src="img/coils/MultiCoil.png" height="150px">]

- DDQ structure is one of the most common multi-coil structures
 - The quadrature (Q) winding is decoupled from the DD winding
 - Thus, both windings can be used independently to transfer power
 - A DD primary and DDQ secondary provides wide spatial tolerance since the Q winding helps transferring power when `\(k\)` between the DD windings drop
- Bi-polar structure employs two overlapping windings that are decoupled from each other
 - When used as a transmitter, each coil can be driven at a desired magnitude and a phase
- Tri-polar and other multi-coil structures typically employ decoupled overlapping windings

# An Uncompensated Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/comp/UncompR.png" height="135px">]

- Assume a load resistor, `\(R_{L}\)`, is connected directly across a pick-up coil, which is coupled to a primary coil 
- The primary coil is driven by the primary converter generating a current `\(I_{pt}\angle 0\)` at an angular frequency `\(\omega = 2\pi f\)`
- The current flowing through pick-up coil as well as the load will be
\\[ I\_{st} = \frac {-V\_{sr}} {R\_{L} + j\omega L\_{st}} = \frac {-\omega MI\_{pt}e^{j\pi/2}} {R\_{L} + j\omega L\_{st}}  \\]
- The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` limits the ability to supply current to `\(R_{L}\)`

---
name: S20

# Power from an Uncompensated Pick-up

.left-column[
- The power delivered to the load is then
\\[ P\_{o} =  \left | I\_{st} \right |^2 R\_{L} = \left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2  \frac {R\_{L}} {R\_{L}^2 + \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 } = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {\omega L\_{st} / R\_{L}} { 1 + \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 / R\_{L}^2 } \\]
- At a load `\(R_L = \omega L_{st}\)`, maximum power is delivered 
\\[ P\_{o\_{(max)}} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2} {2 \omega L\_{st} } = 0.5 V\_{oc}I\_{sc}  = 0.5k^2\mathit{VA}\_{pt} \\]
- As an example, when `\(k = 0.1\)`, to deliver 5 mW to the load, the primary coil should be driven atleast at 1 VA
 - The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` limits the power transfer

# What Should an 'Ideal' Pick-up Look Like?

.center[<img src="img/comp/GenericPower.png" height="150px">]

- The load `\(R_{L}\)` 'ideally' needs to be able to take any amount of power from pick-up
- This could be achieved, for example if the pick-up coil is made to to look like an ideal voltage source
 - The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` need to be made zero 
 - In this case we would have an ideal voltage source, `\(V_{sr}\)`, supplying the load, `\(R_{L}\)` 
- Alternatively, the pick-up coil can be made to look like an ideal current source, `\(I_{sc}\)`
- Resonance can be used to achieve this 'ideal voltage source' or 'ideal current source' type behaviour

---
name: S22

# A Series Compensated Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/comp/SCompR.png" height="150px">]

- The impedance of `\(L_{st}\)` can be compensated using the capacitor `\(C_{st}\)` that is connected in series with `\(L_{st}\)`
- To allow the pick-up to behave like an ideal voltage source, at a given `\(\omega\)`, `\(C_{st}\)` can be selected such that 
\\[ \omega L\_{st} = \frac {1} {\omega C\_{st}} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{st}C\_{st}} } \\]
- The negative impedance of `\(C_{st}\)` cancel the positive impedance of `\(L_{st}\)`, putting `\(R_{L}\)` directly in parallel with `\(V_{sr}\)` since `\(Z_{s} = R_{L}\)`


---
name: S23

# Power Transfer with Series Compensation

.left-column[
- In practice, it is not possible to perfectly compensate the impedance of `\(L_{st}\)`
 - Due to tollerances, temperature, misalignment, etc.
 - There will be some residual impedance left, which can be denoted by `\( \Delta \omega L_{st} \)`
- If perfectly tuned (i.e. `\(\Delta = 0\)`) output power increases with `\(1/R_L\)`
\\[ P\_{o} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 } { R\_{L} }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {\omega L\_{st}} {R\_{L} } \\]
- In practice (i.e. `\(\Delta \neq 0\)`) maximum output power is limited to 
\\[ P\_{o\_{(max)}} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 } { 2 \Delta \omega L\_{st} }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {1+ \Delta} {2 \Delta } \quad \text{at} \quad R\_{L} = \Delta \omega L\_{st}\\]

- The magnitude of the current source is `\(I_{sc} = V_{sr} / j \omega L_{st} \)`
- Unlike in a series compensated pick-up, `\(Z_{s}\)` can only be real at a specific `\(R_{L}\)` while under all other conditions it will be reactive

# Power Transfer with Parallel Compensation

.left-column[
- In practice, it is not possible to perfectly compensate the impedance of `\(L_{st}\)`
 - Due to tollerances, temperature, misalignment, etc.
 - There will be some residual impedance left, which can be denoted by `\( \Delta \)`
- If perfectly tuned (i.e. `\(\Delta = 0\)`) output power increases with `\(R_L\)`
\\[ P\_{o} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 R\_{L} } { \omega^2 L\_{st}^2 }  = k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt} \frac {R\_{L} } {\omega L\_{st}} \\]
- When detuned (i.e. `\(\Delta \neq 0\)`) maximum output power is limited to 
\\[ P\_{o\_{(max)}} =  \frac {\left ( \omega MI\_{pt} \right )^2 } { 2 \Delta (1 + \Delta) \omega L\_{st}}  =  \frac {k^2 \mathit{VA}\_{pt}} {2 \Delta} \quad \text{at} \quad R\_{L} = \omega L\_{st} \frac {1+\Delta} {\Delta}\\]

# Other Compensation Methods

- Many other compensation methods exists 
- For example LCC, which formed by parallel tuning a partially series compensated pick-up coil, or LCL compensation is also common
- More complex compensation networks include
 - LCCL and LCLC
 - Hybrid compensation
 - Impedance compression networks

# Operating Quality Factor of a Pick-up

- `\(P_o\)` of a series compensated pick-up was proportional to `\(\omega L_{st}/R_L\)`, while for a parallel/LCL compensated pick-up `\(P_o\)` was proportional to `\(R_L/\omega L_{st}\)`
- The ratio `\(\omega L_{st}/R_L\)` or `\(R_L/\omega L_{st}\)`, is referred to as the operating quality factor of a pick-up and thus when operated at a load `\(R_L\)`, the operating quality factor of a series compensated pick-up, `\(Q_{ss_{(op)}}\)`, or the operating quality factor of a parallel/LCL compensated pick-up, `\(Q_{sp_{(op)}}\)`, can be given by
 \\[ Q\_{ss\_{{(op)}}} = \frac {\omega L\_{st} } {R\_L} \quad \text{or} \quad Q\_{sp\_{{(op)}}} = \frac {R\_L} {\omega L\_{st} } \\]
- A higher operating `\(Q\)` results in higher power but also makes the pick-up increasingly sensitive to changes
 - As an example, from previous analysis, if operated at a `\(Q_{ss_{(op)}}\)` of 5, a 20% change in `\(L_{st}\)` results in a 40% drop in `\(P_o\)`
 - Typically, an IPT system is designed to have an operating `\(Q\)` of less than 10 
- Note that `\(Q_{pt}\)` and `\(Q_{st}\)` are a measure of the coil quality and it is therefore desirable to for these to be much larger than the operating `\(Q\)`

# Reflected Impedance on to Primary

.center[<img src="img/netw/RefImp.png" height="135px">]

- The pick-up can be modelled as `\(V_{sr}\)` driving into `\(Z_s\)`, which models the pick-up compensation and the load
- Current flowing through the pick-up coil is therefore 
\\[ I\_{st} = -V\_{sr} / Z\_s = -j \omega M I\_{pt} / Z\_s \\]
- `\(I_{st}\)` induces a voltage, `\(V_{pr}\)`, across the primary coil, which can be given by
\\[ V\_{pr} = j \omega M I\_{st} = \omega^2 M^2 I\_{pt} / Z\_s \\]
- `\(V_{pr}\)` can also be represented as a reflected impedance where `\(Z_{pr} = \omega^2 M^2 / Z_s \)`

# Primary Compensation Networks

.center[<img src="img/netw/PCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- Directly driving the highly inductive load consisting of `\(L_{pt}\)` and `\(Z_{pr}\)` with a power converter can be very inefficient and costly
 - For example the VA rating of the converter, which is required to deliver `\(1W\)` to the pick-up load, can be in excess of `\(1/(k^2Q_{ss/sp_{(op)}})\)`
 - If `\(k = 0.1\)` and `\(Q_{ss/sp_{(op)}}=5\)`, which are typical for an IPT system, the primary converter will need to be supply 20VA to deliver 1W to the load
- Compensation networks are used to reduce the VA demand of the primary converter
- Series or LCL compensation is commonly employed if the primary is driven by a voltage source converter  
- Parallel compensation is commonly employed if the primary is driven by a current source converter

# A Series Compensated Primary (P-I)

.center[<img src="img/netw/SCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- The impedance of `\(L_{pt}\)` can be compensated using the capacitor `\(C_{pt}\)` that is connected in series with `\(L_{pt}\)`
- At a given operating `\(\omega\)` (i.e. fundamental of `\(V_{pi}\)`), `\(C_{pt}\)` can be selected to negate `\(L_{pt}\)` by ensuring
\\[ \omega L\_{pt} = \frac {1} {\omega C\_{pt}} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{pt}C\_{pt}} } \\]
- When `\(C_{pt}\)` is designed to fully compensate `\(L_{pt}\)`, the primary converter drives an impedance
\\[ Z\_{p} = Z\_{pr} = \omega^2 M^2 / Z\_s \\]

---
name: S31

# A Series Compensated Primary (P-II)

.center[<img src="img/netw/SCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- In a typical IPT system, the pick-up compensation network ensures that `\(Z_{s}\)` is mostly resistive 
 - For example, in an ideally series compensated pick-up, `\(Z_{s} = R_L\)`
 - Or in an ideally parallel compensated pick-up, 
- Thus when the primary coil is fully series compensated 
\\[ Z\_{p} = \frac {\omega^2 M^2} {R\_L}  \\]
 - The primary converter and the primary coil currents become `\(I_{pi} = V_{pi}R_L / \omega^2 M^2 \)`
 - Primary converter will only have to be supply 1VA to deliver 1W to the load

---
name: S32

# An LCL Compensated Primary

.center[<img src="img/netw/LCLCompGen.png" height="135px">]

- The impedance of `\(L_{pt}\)` is compensated using the capacitor `\(C_{pt}\)` and the inductor `\(L_{pi}\)`
- Typically, at a given operating `\(\omega\)` (i.e. fundamental of `\(V_{pi}\)`), `\(C_{pt}\)` and `\(L_{pi}\)` are chosen such that 
\\[ \omega L\_{pt} = \frac {1} {\omega C\_{pt}} = \omega L\_{pi} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{pt}C\_{pt}} } =  \frac {1} { \sqrt {L\_{pi}C\_{pt}} } \\]
- Thus, when the LCL network uses matching impedances, and if the pick-up is series compensated
\\[ Z\_{p} = \omega^2 L\_{pi}^2 \times R\_L / ( \omega^2 M^2 )  \\]

# Voltage Source Converters

.left-column[
- A full-bridge converter is typically used to drive a series/LCL compensated primary coil
- Half-bridge converters may be used in low power applications
- The primary converter can be fed from the grid through a PFC stage or a grid-tied inverter or directly from a DC source
- The frequency of the fundamental component of `\(v_{pi}\)` generated by the converter is at or near the tuned frequency of the compensation network (10's of kHz)
- Traditional PWM schemes cannot be used to regulate, `\(V_{pi(1)}\)` (same as `\(V_{pi}\)`), the phasor magnitude of the fundamental component of `\(v_{pi}\)`
- Typically, voltage cancellation schemes are used, for example using phase-shift modulation to regulate the magnitude of `\(V_{pi}\)`

# Phase-Shift Modulation

.center[<img src="img/conv/PShiftGen.png" height="220px">]

- The switches are operated at a frequency `\(f_{s}\)`, where `\(f_{s}\)` is equal to or close to the tunned frequency of the compensation network
- Each leg of the full-bridge operated at 50% duty-cycle, generating the square-waves `\(v_{pa}\)` and `\(v_{pb}\)`
- The phase-shift modulation, `\(\phi_{p}\)`, applied between `\(v_{pa}\)` and `\(v_{pb}\)`, regulates the magnitude of the fundamental component of `\(v_{pi}\)`, since `\(v_{pi}=v_{pa}-v_{pb}\)`
 - When `\(\phi_{p} = \pi\)`, `\(V_{pi}\)` is a maximum

---
name: S36

# Current Source Converters

.center[<img src="img/conv/CSIGen.png" height="180px">]

- Current source push-pull converters are widely used in low power IPT applications
 - Drives a parallel compensated primary coil at resonance in autonomous operating mode or near resonance in fixed-frequency operating mode
- Not widely used in high-power applications 
 - Require a large DC inductor
 - Sensitive to changes in operating conditions
- Current source full-bridge converters may be used in higher power applications

# Pick-up Converters

.center[<img src="img/pkup/PickupGen.png" height="110px">]

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>
- In most applications a rectifier is used to derive a DC output
- In some applications, current doubler rectifiers are used to increase the power transfer capability of a parallel compensated pick-up 
- Following the rectifier, a DC-DC converter is often used to regulate the output 
- Alternatively, an active rectifier may be used for rectification and regulation while also providing additional functionalities such as bi-directional power flow or improved misalignment tolerance
 - However, the active rectifier needs to be synchronised with the primary converter 
- Direct AC-AC processing pick-up converters may be used if an AC output is required

# Rectification of a Series Compensated Pick-up

.center[<img src="img/pkup/PickupSWV2.png" height="175px">]

- A diode rectifier and a filter capacitor used to derive a DC output 
- The pick-up behaves as a voltage source maintaining a nearly constant DC voltage across `\(R_{L}\)`
- Assuming `\(\omega L_{st} = 1 / \omega C_{st}\)` and `\(I_{si}\)` is sinusoidal,
\\[ P\_{o} = \frac {\pi^2} {8} \frac {V^2\_{sr}} {R\_{L(dc)}}  \quad \text{&} \quad R\_{L(dc)} = \frac {\pi^2} {8}  R\_{L(ac)} \\]

# Rectification of a Parallel Compensated Pick-up

- A diode rectifier, a DC inductor and a filter capacitor used 
- The pick-up behaves as a current source maintaining a nearly constant DC current through `\(R_{L}\)`
- Assuming `\(\omega L_{st} = 1 / \omega C_{st}\)` and `\(V_{si}\)` is sinusoidal,
\\[ P\_{o} = \frac {\pi^2} {8}  I^2\_{sc} R\_{L(dc)} \quad \text{&} \quad R\_{L(dc)} = \frac {8} {\pi^2}  R\_{L(ac)} \\]

name: S40

# Short-Circuit Regulator

.center[<img src="img/pkup/ShortCctReg.png" height="200px">]

- Following the rectifier, a short-circuit (boost) regulator, can be used to regulate the output of a parallel compensated IPT pick-up
- The duty-cycle, `\(D_{scr}\)`, of `\(Q_{1}\)` is controlled to regulate `\(I_{out}\)`, and therefore `\(V_{out}\)`
- `\(Q_{1}\)` can be operated either at a 'low' switching frequency using a hysteritic controller or at a 'high' switching frequency using for example a PI controller
- `\(L_{dc}\)` should be sufficiently large to maintain `\(I_{Ldc}\)` continuous

---
name: S41

# Active Rectifiers

.center[<img src="img/pkup/ActiveRect.png" height="140px">]

- A typical active rectifier employs a full-bridge converter that is controlled to generate a `\(V_{si}\)` that leads or lags `\(V_{pi}\)` by a phase-angle `\(\theta\)`
- `\(\theta\)` can be controlled together with the amplitude of `\(V_{si}\)` to generate a specific AC impedance, `\(Z_{L(ac)}\)`, across pick-up compensation network
- The reactive part of `\(Z_{L(ac)}\)` can be used to improve power transfer and/or reduce losses, especially when operated under misaligned conditions
- In applications requiring only uni-directional power flow, two of the switches in the full-bridge can be replaced with diodes
